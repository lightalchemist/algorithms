algorithms
==========

This is a collection of well-known algorithms that I implemented for the
purpose of self-study.

The code is written in a manner that is (I hope) as readable as possible
so that it will be easy for anyone trying to learn this algorithms to
understand them. Hence, under this consideration, the code here is not
necessarily the most efficient implementation possible.


Currently implemented:
* Finite automata for string matching
* Longest common subsequence using dynamic programming
* String alignment using dynamic programming
* Weighted interval scheduling using dynamic programming
* Knapsack with integer weights, values, and knapsack capacity using dynamic
  programming.
